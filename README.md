# charge_hydrophobic_quantification
This code can be used to quantify the charged+polar and hydrophobic residues within a given amino acid sequence

Input sequence as b (between the apostrophes) and run code. 
Results will show the total number of; charged and polar residues together,  hydrophobic residues and the total length of the sequence.
It will also display the number. of methionines, tryptophan and any residues represented by X (which usually stands for any amino acid).
